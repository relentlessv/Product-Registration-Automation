# Product-Registration-Automation
Product Registration Automation This Python script automates product registration in a web system using Selenium and Pandas. It logs in, imports an Excel file, and fills fields like code, brand, category, and price. Inspired by Hashtag Programação, it includes a pause feature with keyboard for better control.
