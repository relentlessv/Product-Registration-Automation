# Product-Registration-Automation
Product Registration Automation This Python script automates product registration in a web system using Selenium and Pandas. It logs in, imports an Excel file, and fills fields like code, brand, category, and price. Inspired by Hashtag Programação, it includes a pause feature with keyboard for better control. 
Credits
This project was inspired by a live session from Hashtag Programação, where I learned fundamental concepts about automation using Python, Selenium, and data manipulation with Pandas.

The code presented here was adapted and expanded based on what was taught, and the website used in the script is merely an example demonstrated during the live session. I highly recommend checking out their content to learn more about programming and automation!
